# Python Automation Playground

This repository contains small, focused Python automation scripts
covering filesystem operations, time/datetime handling, cleanup tools,
and system automation.

Purpose:
- Build strong automation fundamentals
- Practice safe, industry-style Python scripting
- Serve as a personal reference and learning log

Each script is standalone and intentionally minimal.
